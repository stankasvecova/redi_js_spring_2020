The goal of todays class work is to make a sort of visual additional calculator using what we have learned in the first few lectures.

    variables, strings and numbers
    basic functions
    document selectors like getElementById
    document events like “change” and “click” via addEventListener
    html element creation with createElement and appendChild


The app is comprised of four components:

    numbers list
    sum
    add button
    input

It should work as follows:

    numbers are entered into the input
    upon clicking the add button the current number in the input is added to the numbers list and the sum of the numbers is recalculated
    after the number is added the input is cleared

Tips

    it is possible to create this app without logic operators / control statements. No if statements needed
    consider keeping state like the sum in a global variable and only writing the sum element not reading
